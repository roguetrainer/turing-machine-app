🧮 The foundation of all computing remains a simple 🤔 thought ⚗️ experiment: The Turing Machine.

#OnThisDay 89 years ago.

💡 Alan Turing's famous paper, titled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," was formally communicated to the London Mathematical Society and was read on November 12, 1936.

Not unsurprisingly, we can model one universal computing machine using another universal computing machine! Um, that's the whole point! 🙈 

Such an exercise is an incredible reminder of where computational power truly originates. This minimal, abstract model defines **computational universality** (the Church-Turing Thesis), proving its capability to execute any modern algorithm.

The TM is not just a historical curiosity; it’s the bedrock of modern theory:

1.  **The Limits of Logic:** Confronting the TM immediately forces us to address the **Halting Problem**—the fundamental boundary that Gödel and Turing established for what is provable and what is computable.
2.  **Complexity:** It serves as the abstract machine that defines **Complexity Theory** (P vs. NP), classifying algorithms based on the time and space required to solve them.

For the implementation, we chose **F\#**. Its functional, immutable nature (using Discriminated Unions and pure state transitions) perfectly mirrors the TM’s formal definition. This is a powerful lesson: using the right paradigm can make complex, theoretical concepts clean and elegant in code.

🦫 Examples include the famous Busy Beaver Problem. 

🐍 Plus for mainstream language folks there's python code here too.
